# Machine-Learning-Coursera-Assignments

This repository contains my submissions for the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. All the assignments were attempted in Octave.

The purpose of re-doing these assignments (and the course materials) was to brush up my concepts once, in order to pursue higher level courses for which Machine Learning is a pre-requisite.
